*Currently all Rendering is based on the "Top Left" Tile corner*
☐ Base all movement around the collision mask
	☐ Readjust Renderer to offset ALL renderings to be "Center Tile" rather than "Top Left"
		☐ Shift Canvas and/or anything else if bleeding off screen
		☐ Ensure boundary conditions are met and that Entity can run in close proximity to ALL edges
	☐ Migrate to Boundary Circles for obvious reasons
	☐ @bug Since movement is based *only* on current tile, character gets stuck _once_ they enter the non-navigable terrain (and thus can't leave)
	
☐ Create a EntityNodeChange Event and Message and convert the Mutator > Maps:119 > map.UpdateNodeOccupancy(entity); to be controlled by an Event
