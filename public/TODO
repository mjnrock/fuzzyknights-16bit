*Currently all Rendering is based on the "Top Left" Tile corner*
☐ Base all movement around the collision mask
	Render:
	☐ Readjust Renderer to offset ALL renderings to be "Center Tile" rather than "Top Left"
		☐ Shift Canvas and/or anything else if bleeding off screen
		☐ Ensure boundary conditions are met and that Entity can run in close proximity to ALL edges
	
	Collision:
	☐ Make GetNeighbor functions to get all Tiles within X-Tile radius
	☐ Move based on checking neighboring nodes for Entities and iterating through their collision masks
	
☐ Create a EntityNodeChange Event and Message and convert the Mutator > Maps:119 > map.UpdateNodeOccupancy(entity); to be controlled by an Event
☐ Introduce a TerrainMovementGrid that is just an array of ALL of the Navigability Speeds to their Tile X,Y positions
