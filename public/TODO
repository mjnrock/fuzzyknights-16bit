*Currently all Rendering is based on the "Top Left" Tile corner*
Render:
✔ Readjust Renderer to offset ALL renderings to be "Center Tile" rather than "Top Left" @done(18-12-31 01:02)
	☐ Shift Canvas and/or anything else if bleeding off screen
	☐ Ensure boundary conditions are met and that Entity can run in close proximity to ALL edges

Collision:
✔ Base all movement around the collision mask @done(18-12-31 01:04)
✔ Make GetNeighbor functions to get all Tiles within X-Tile radius @done(18-12-31 01:02)
✔ Move based on checking neighboring nodes for Entities and iterating through their collision masks @done(18-12-31 01:02)
☐ Spawn an Entity for EVERYTHING (e.g. Abilities, Attacks, etc.) and use Map.IsPointWithinPolygon to test if should invoke EntityCollisionEvent
	
EntityManager <-> Map Coupling:
☐ Move .Tick() position functionality into (create) Map.Tick()
	☐ Check if Map is the MapManager's ActiveMap (UUID compare) so that all Entity position functionality is handled by Map
	☐ Run through EntityManager's registry and check if their (Maps Mutator) MapIdentifier is ActiveMap, if so, Entity.Tick()

Refactors/Optimizers:
☐ Create a EntityNodeChange Event and Message and convert the Mutator > Maps:119 > map.UpdateNodeOccupancy(entity); to be controlled by an Event
☐ Introduce a TerrainMovementGrid that is just an array of ALL of the Navigability Speeds to their Tile X,Y positions
